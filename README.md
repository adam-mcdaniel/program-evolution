# program-evolution

This repository implements a genetic algorithm on programs for the [sage virtual machine](https://github.com/adam-mcdaniel/sage), and also supersets of the virtual machine. Programs can either be synthesized to optimize a fitness function, or an existing sage program can be refined according to a fitness function. This fitness function can optimize for size, speed, correctness. See our poster below for our results and some visualizations.
