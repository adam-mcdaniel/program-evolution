# program-evolution

This repository implements a genetic algorithm on programs for the [sage virtual machine](https://github.com/adam-mcdaniel/sage), and also supersets of the virtual machine. Our program takes compiled code and optimizes it for the number of instructions: some programs shrank as much as 20% in size. It can also generate programs from scratch to fulfill a fitness function.
